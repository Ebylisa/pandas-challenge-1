# Pandas-Challenge-1
AI Module 4 Challenge

## ## Challenge Background and Objective:
This module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library which includes the examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets in order to address real-world business questions. The objective of this project is to identify top customers, popular product categories, and calculate profits using python and panda functions for data exploration, transformation, and analysis. This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/Ebylisa/pandas-challenge-/blob/main/Starter_Code/module_4_challenge.ipynb).

## Code Summary:
(1)	- A repository was created called pandas-challenge-1 in Git hub. (2) - A starter code named module_4_challenge.ipynb was created on the local Git repository and pushed to GitHub. (3) - The csv file client_dataset.csv was imported. (4) - The csv file was read into the data frame. (5) - The data was viewed in several ways using df.columns,  df.describe  and df.info. (6) -Data was analyzed to determine the categories and subcategories with the most entries. (7) The data was further analyzed to determine clients/client had the most entries and total units purchased (8) The data was transformed to create new columns for line subtotal, shipping price, total price, and cost. (8) - The new transformed data was then confirmed for accuracy based on a set of sample orders. (9) - The data was further analyzed and summarized to show data for the top 5 clients. (10) â€“ Columns on the summary dataframe were renamed for better presentation. (11) Data was processed further to convert currency values into millions and finally sorted to show the overall profitability for the top 5. 

# Conclusion
The data appears to show that Client ID 24741 was significanty more profitable than the other top 5 clients.  There was a significant gap which appears to be contributed to the quantity of units sold, which ultimately will lead to greater profits.
